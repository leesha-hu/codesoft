Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains three machine learning projects built using Python and Jupyter Notebook. Each project focuses on solving real-world classification problems with data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Projects Included:
1. Spam Classification
Goal: Classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate (ham).
Techniques Used: TF-IDF vectorization and classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM.

2. Customer Churn Prediction
Goal: Predict whether a customer will leave a company based on historical data.
Algorithms Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.

3. Credit Card Fraud Detection
Goal: Detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
Algorithms Used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
